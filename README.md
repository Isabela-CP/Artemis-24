Project for Space Apps Challenge 2021

Have you ever dreamed of being part of a space journey? 
Well now, thanks to Artemis 24, an inclusive and educational game, it can be possible. Along your journey, you will be able to learn more about how various things work, for example, how communication between the Moon and Earth is made. Not to mention that you can really feel part of the crew while you're fixing an instrument or helping someone injured!

Let your dreams come true and embark on this adventure! 🚀
